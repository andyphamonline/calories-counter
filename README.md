##Approaches
I created page by page then edit my models along they way to make it work. I use `session` to keep track of user logged in and date selected. Every user has a goal that can be edited. User can also select date & food to add into their log. Then they can look at log of each date that they created. 
My models relationship are user 1:M nutrient. User 1:M log. Nutrient 1:1 log.

##Issues
My wireframe & outline were detail enough so I was struggling with the route of the site.
